This is my Note App build on React using TypeScript 



🧑‍💻Functionality:

    ✅ Adding notes with limit number of characters
    ✅ App saves note  when user stops typing without
      the need to click submit button
    ✅ Search bar with ability to search note by title
    ✅ Button that changes color theme
    ✅ Local storage is used and notes don't disapper
      when user refresh the page
    ✅ Page is responsive for all device types 

Hope you enjoy my project🙌
