    This is my Note App build on React using TypeScript

Functionality:
    - Adding notes with limit number of characters
    - App saves note  when user stops typing without
      the need to click submit button
    - Search bar with ability to search note by title
    - Button that changes color theme
    - Local storage is used and notes don't disapper
      when user refresh the page
    - Page is responsive for all device types 

Hope you enjoy my project🙌
